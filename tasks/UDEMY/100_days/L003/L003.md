Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.\
e.g. 86 is even because 86 ÷ 2 = 43\
43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore, the division is clean.\
e.g. 59 is odd because 59 ÷ 2 = 29.5\
29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore, there is a 
remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.
