- **[BSON](https://bsonspec.org/)** - BSON is a specification for a rich set of scalar types (int32, int64, decimal, date, etc.) plus containers (object a.k.a. a map, and array) as they might appear in a byte stream. There is no "native" string form of BSON; it is a byte[] spec.
- **[bulma](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma)** - Bulma is a CSS framework. As such, the sole output is a single CSS file. Bulma can be considered "environment agnostic": it's just the style layer on top of the logic.



# C

- **[celery](https://github.com/celery/celery)** - Task queues are used as a mechanism to distribute work across threads or machines.
- **[CFFI](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** - C Foreign Function Interface for Python. Interact with almost any C code from Python, based on C-like declarations that you can often copy-paste from header files or documentation.

# F
- **[flask-caching](https://github.m/pallets-eco/flask-caching)** - A fork of the Flask-cache extension which adds easy cache support to Flask.

# G
- **[GridFS](https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/gridfs/gridfs-spec.rst/)** - GridFS is a convention drivers use to store and retrieve BSON binary data (type “\x05”) that exceeds MongoDB’s BSON-document size limit of 16 MiB. When this data, called a user file, is written to the system, GridFS divides the file into chunks that are stored as distinct documents in a chunks collection. To retrieve a stored file, GridFS locates and returns all of its component chunks. Internally, GridFS creates a files collection document for each stored file. Files collection documents hold information about stored files, and they are stored in a files collection.

# J
- **[JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)** - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write.

- **[litecli](https://github.com/dbcli/litecli)** - A command-line client for SQLite databases that has auto-completion and syntax highlighting.
- **[librabbitmq](https://github.com/celery/librabbitmq)** - Python AMQP Client using the rabbitmq-c library. Python bindings to the RabbitMQ C-library rabbitmq-c. Supported by Kombu and Celery.
- [LRU cache](https://www.educative.io/m/implement-least-recently-used-cache) - Least Recently Used (LRU) is a common caching strategy. It defines the policy to evict elements from the cache to make room for new elements when the cache is full, meaning it discards the least recently used items first.

# M
- **[mongita](https://github.com/scottrogowski/mongita)** - Mongita is a lightweight embedded document database that implements a commonly-used subset of the MongoDB/PyMongo interface. Mongita differs from MongoDB in that instead of being a server, Mongita is a self-contained Python library. Mongita can be configured to store its documents either on disk or in memory.
- **[mycli](https://github.com/dbcli/mycli)** - A command line client for MySQL that can do auto-completion and syntax highlighting.
- **[mongo-express](https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express)** - Web-based MongoDB admin interface written with Node.js, Express and Bootstrap3

# O
- [optparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/optparse.html) - optparse is a more convenient, flexible, and powerful library for parsing command-line options than the old getopt module.

# P
- **[pipreqs](https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs)** - Pip requirements.txt generator based on imports in project.
- **[pipdeptree](https://github.com/tox-dev/pipdeptree)** - is a command line utility for displaying the installed python packages in form of a dependency tree.
- **[PhantomJS](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs)** - PhantomJS is a headless Webkit, which has a number of uses. In this example, we’ll be using it, in conjunction with Selenium WebDriver, for conducting basic system tests directly from the command line. Since PhantomJS eliminates the need for a graphical browser, tests run much faster.
- **[pymongo](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver)** - The PyMongo distribution contains tools for interacting with MongoDB database from Python. The bson package is an implementation of the BSON format for Python. The pymongo package is a native Python driver for MongoDB. The gridfs package is a gridfs implementation on top of pymongo. PyMongo supports MongoDB 3.6, 4.0, 4.2, 4.4, 5.0, and 6.0.
- **[python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv)** - Python-dotenv reads key-value pairs from a .env file and can set them as environment variables. It helps in the development of applications following the 12-factor principles. By default, load_dotenv doesn't override existing environment variables.
- **[python-humanfriendly](https://github.com/xolox/python-humanfriendly)** - humanfriendly: Human friendly input/output in Python




# Q

# R
- [**redis**](https://github.com/redis/redis) - Redis is often referred to as a data structures server. What this means is that Redis provides access to mutable data structures via a set of commands, which are sent using a server-client model with TCP sockets and a simple protocol. So different processes can query and modify the same data structures in a shared way. [Redis data types](https://redis.io/docs/).
- **[rabbitmq](https://github.com/rabbitmq)** - RabbitMQ is a feature rich, multi-protocol messaging and streaming broker. It supports: AMQP 0-9-1

# S
- **[spynner](https://github.com/makinacorpus/spynner)** - Spynner is a stateful programmatic web browser module for Python. It is based upon PyQT and WebKit. It supports Javascript, AJAX, and every other technology that !WebKit is able to handle (Flash, SVG, ...). Spynner takes advantage of JQuery. a powerful Javascript library that makes the interaction with pages and event simulation really easy. Using Spynner you would able to simulate a web browser with no GUI (though a browsing window can be opened for debugging purposes), so it may be used to implement crawlers or acceptance testing tools.


# T
- **[tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)** - TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence Research organization to conduct machine learning and deep neural networks research.
