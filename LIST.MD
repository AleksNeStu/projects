# B
- **[BSON](https://bsonspec.org/)** - BSON is a specification for a rich set of scalar types (int32, int64, decimal, date, etc.) plus containers (object a.k.a. a map, and array) as they might appear in a byte stream. There is no "native" string form of BSON; it is a byte[] spec.

# C
- **[codetiming](https://github.com/realpython/codetiming)** - A flexible, customizable timer for your Python code

- **[GridFS](https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/gridfs/gridfs-spec.rst/)** - GridFS is a convention drivers use to store and retrieve BSON binary data (type “\x05”) that exceeds MongoDB’s BSON-document size limit of 16 MiB. When this data, called a user file, is written to the system, GridFS divides the file into chunks that are stored as distinct documents in a chunks collection. To retrieve a stored file, GridFS locates and returns all of its component chunks. Internally, GridFS creates a files collection document for each stored file. Files collection documents hold information about stored files, and they are stored in a files collection.

# H

# J
- **[JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)** - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write.

# K

# L
- **[litecli](https://github.com/dbcli/litecli)** - A command-line client for SQLite databases that has auto-completion and syntax highlighting.



# M
- **[mongita](https://github.com/scottrogowski/mongita)** - Mongita is a lightweight embedded document database that implements a commonly-used subset of the MongoDB/PyMongo interface. Mongita differs from MongoDB in that instead of being a server, Mongita is a self-contained Python library. Mongita can be configured to store its documents either on disk or in memory.
- **[mycli](https://github.com/dbcli/mycli)** - A command line client for MySQL that can do auto-completion and syntax highlighting.
- **[mongo-express](https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express)** - Web-based MongoDB admin interface written with Node.js, Express and Bootstrap3



# N

# P
- **[pipreqs](https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs)** - Pip requirements.txt generator based on imports in project.
- **[pipdeptree](https://github.com/tox-dev/pipdeptree)** - is a command line utility for displaying the installed python packages in form of a dependency tree.
- **[PhantomJS](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs)** - PhantomJS is a headless Webkit, which has a number of uses. In this example, we’ll be using it, in conjunction with Selenium WebDriver, for conducting basic system tests directly from the command line. Since PhantomJS eliminates the need for a graphical browser, tests run much faster.
- **[pymongo](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver)** - The PyMongo distribution contains tools for interacting with MongoDB database from Python. The bson package is an implementation of the BSON format for Python. The pymongo package is a native Python driver for MongoDB. The gridfs package is a gridfs implementation on top of pymongo. PyMongo supports MongoDB 3.6, 4.0, 4.2, 4.4, 5.0, and 6.0.

- **[spynner](https://github.com/makinacorpus/spynner)** - Spynner is a stateful programmatic web browser module for Python. It is based upon PyQT and WebKit. It supports Javascript, AJAX, and every other technology that !WebKit is able to handle (Flash, SVG, ...). Spynner takes advantage of JQuery. a powerful Javascript library that makes the interaction with pages and event simulation really easy. Using Spynner you would able to simulate a web browser with no GUI (though a browsing window can be opened for debugging purposes), so it may be used to implement crawlers or acceptance testing tools.


# T
- **[tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)** - TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence Research organization to conduct machine learning and deep neural networks research.

# W
- **[webbrowser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/webbrowser.html#module-webbrowser)** - module provides a high-level interface to allow displaying web-based documents to users. Under most circumstances, simply calling the open() function from this module will do the right thing.
- **[Webkit](https://webkit.org/)** - WebKit is the web browser engine used by Safari, Mail, App Store, and many other apps on macOS, iOS, and Linux.

- **[yolk](https://github.com/cakebread/yolk)** - Command-line tool for querying PyPI and Python packages installed on your system
- **[yolk3k](https://github.com/myint/yolk)**: yolk3k is a fork of the original yolk. yolk3k add Python 3 support (while maintaining Python 2 support). It also adds additional features.
