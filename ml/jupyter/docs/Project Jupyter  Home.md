## JupyterLab: A Next-Generation Notebook Interface

JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality.

## Jupyter Notebook: The Classic Notebook Interface

The Jupyter Notebook is the original web application for creating and sharing computational documents. It offers a simple, streamlined, document-centric experience.

### Language of choice

Jupyter supports over 40 programming languages, including Python, R, Julia, and Scala.

### Interactive output

Your code can produce rich, interactive output: HTML, images, videos, LaTeX, and custom MIME types.

### Big data integration

Leverage big data tools, such as Apache Spark, from Python, R, and Scala. Explore that same data with pandas, scikit-learn, ggplot2, and TensorFlow.

### Pluggable authentication

Manage users and authentication with PAM, OAuth or integrate with your own directory service system.

### Centralized deployment

Deploy the Jupyter Notebook to thousands of users in your organization on centralized infrastructure on- or off-site.

### Container friendly

Use Docker and Kubernetes to scale your deployment, isolate user processes, and simplify software installation.

### Code meets data

Deploy the Notebook next to your data to provide unified software management and data access within your organization.

## Voilà: Share your results

Voilà helps communicate insights by transforming notebooks into secure, stand-alone web applications that you can customize and share.

## Open Standards for Interactive Computing

Project Jupyter promotes open standards that third-party developers can leverage to build customized applications. Think HTML and CSS for interactive computing on the web.

### Notebook Document Format

Jupyter Notebooks are an open document format based on JSON. They contain a complete record of the user's sessions and include code, narrative text, equations, and rich output.

### Interactive Computing Protocol

The Notebook communicates with computational Kernels using the Interactive Computing Protocol, an open network protocol based on JSON data over ZMQ, and WebSockets.

### The Kernel

Kernels are processes that run interactive code in a particular programming language and return output to the user. Kernels also respond to tab completion and introspection requests.
