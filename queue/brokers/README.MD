# II) Description
A message broker allows applications, systems, and services to communicate and exchange information with each other. Now, with a task queue software in the background, the web app needs to know the status of the job in progress, plus any errors that might occur and the result of the enhancement. A message broker eases this process since it’s built to make independent processes i.e.“talk to each other”.\
