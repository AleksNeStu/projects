- Python3
- [Jinja](https://github.com/pallets/jinja) <br>
  Jinja is a fast, expressive, extensible templating engine. Special placeholders in the template allow writing code similar to Python syntax. Then the template is passed data to render the final document.
- [flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) <br>
  Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.

  - [Werkzeug](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug) <br>
    Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. It began as a simple collection of various utilities for WSGI applications and has become one of the most advanced WSGI utility libraries.
- [sqlalchemy](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy) <br>
  SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL. SQLAlchemy provides a full suite of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple and Pythonic domain language.

- [Nginx / uWSGI]()

  <p>uWSGI is a software application that "aims at developing a full stack for building hosting services".[3] It is named after the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI), which was the first plugin supported by the project.[3]<br>
  <p>uwsgi (all lowercase) is the native binary protocol that uWSGI uses to communicate with other servers.[4] <br>
  <p> uWSGI is often used for serving Python web applications in conjunction with web servers such as Cherokee and Nginx, which offer direct support for uWSGI's native uwsgi protocol.[5] For example, data may flow like this: HTTP client ↔ Nginx ↔ uWSGI ↔ Python app.<br>
  <p> Nginx is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache.<br>
