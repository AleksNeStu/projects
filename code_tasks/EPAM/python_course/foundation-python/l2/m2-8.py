a = 10
b = 20


# + Addition
# a + b = 30


# - Subtraction
# a – b = -10


# * Multiplication
# a * b = 200


# / Division
# b / a = 2


# % Modulus
# b % a = 0


# ** Exponent
# a**b =10 to the power 20


# //	Floor Division
# The division of operands where the result is the quotient in which the digits
# after the decimal point are removed. But if one of the operands is negative,
# the result is floored, i.e., rounded away from zero (towards negative infinity)
# −	9//2 = 4 and 9.0//2.0 = 4.0, -11//3 = -4, -11.0//3 = -4.0
