FUNCTIONS:

1. Write a Python function to find the Max of three numbers.

2. Write a Python program to reverse a string.
Sample String : "1234abcd"
Expected Output : "dcba4321"


3. Write a Python function to sum all the numbers in a list.
Sample List : (8, 2, 3, 0, 7)
Expected Output : 20

4. Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number
(a non-negative integer). The function accepts the number as an argument.


5. Write a Python function to multiply all the numbers in a list.
Sample List : (8, 2, 3, -1, 7)
Expected Output : -336


6. Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculate the number of
upper case letters and lower case letters.
Sample String : 'The quick Brow Fox'
Expected Output :
No. of Upper case characters : 3
No. of Lower case Characters : 12


7. Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique
elements of the first list.
Sample List : [1,2,3,3,3,3,4,5]
Unique List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


8. Write a Python function that takes a number as a parameter and check the
number is prime or not.
Note : A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 and that
has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

9. Write a Python program to make a chain of function decorators (bold, italic,
underline etc.) in Python.


10. Write a Python program to execute a string containing Python code.


11. Write a Python program to access a function inside a function.


12. Write a Python program to detect the number of local variables declared in
a function.


13. Write a Python program to print the even numbers from a given list.
Sample List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Expected Result : [2, 4, 6, 8]

14. Write a Python function to check whether a number is perfect or not.
According to Wikipedia : In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer
 that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of
 its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum).
  Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its
   positive divisors (including itself).
Example : The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2, and 3 are its proper
positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to
half the sum of all its positive divisors: ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6. The next
 perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. This is followed by the perfect
 numbers 496 and 8128.

15. Write a Python program that accepts a hyphen-separated sequence of words
as input and prints the words in a hyphen-separated sequence after sorting
them alphabetically.
Sample Items : green-red-yellow-black-white
Expected Result : black-green-red-white-yellow
