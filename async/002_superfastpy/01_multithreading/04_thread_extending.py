# Example of Extending the Thread Class
# Running the example first creates an instance of the thread, then executes the content of the run() function.
from time import sleep
import threading as th


# custom thread class
class CustomThread(th.Thread):
    # override the run function
    # override the run() instance method and define the code that we wish to execute in another thread.
    def run(self):
        # block for a moment
        sleep(2)
        # display a message
        print('From another thread')


# create the thread
thread = CustomThread()
# start the thread
# The code will then run in a new thread as soon as the operating system can schedule it.
# create an instance of our CustomThread class and call the start() function to begin executing our run() function in
# another thread. Internally, the start() function will call the run() function.
thread.start()
# wait for the thread to finish
print('Waiting for the thread to finish')
thread.join()
print('Main thread done')
