# The problem
# Sometimes you may want to impose a timeout on a Python function. Why would you want to do such a thing? Let’s say
# you’re computing something but you know there are some hopeless scenarios where the computation just takes too
# long, and you’d be OK to just skip them and go on with the rest of the workflow.
#
# For an illustration, the figure below shows several tasks. Those that take longer than the specified timeout should
# be aborted (orange) and the remaining tasks that take a reasonable amount of time should be executed normally (green).

# Solution using the multiprocessing module
import multiprocessing as mp
import random
import time


def do_stuff(n):
    time.sleep(n)
    print('slept for {}s'.format(n))


# runs indefinitely. At each passage through the infinite loop, it randomly selects a duration between 1 and 5
# seconds. It then spawns a new multiprocessing.Process that executes the time-consuming do_stuff() function for the
# random duration. If do_stuff() doesn’t finish in 3 seconds (actually, 3.01 seconds), the process terminates:
def main():
    max_duration = 3

    while True:
        duration = random.choice([x for x in range(1, 5)])
        print('duration = {}: '.format(duration), end='', flush=True)

        # do_stuff() run until it either completes or hits the 3-second mark,
        # whichever event comes first
        process = mp.Process(target=do_stuff, args=(duration,))
        process.start()

        # 1) use a non-integer timeout, not like in signal
        # 2) Although multiprocessing is the package that comes to mind when attempting to parallelize processes,
        # its basic role is to simply spawn processes, as its name implies. (Processes spawned with multiprocessing
        # may, but do not have to, be parallel.) We can set a timeout on the processes that are spawned,
        # which is exactly what we are looking for here.
        # 3)  we actually specify the timeout. In other words, we wait for it to finish for the specified timeout.
        process.join(timeout=max_duration + 0.01)

        # we check whether the process actually finished, in which case is_alive() returns false. If it is still
        # running, we terminate the process and display a message on STDOUT.
        if process.is_alive():
            process.terminate()
            process.join()
            print('took too long')


# duration = 3: slept for 3s
# duration = 4: took too long
# duration = 3: Process Process-4:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

# 1) Simply spawning processes with the multiprocessing module does not mean we have parallelism. In order to do this
# we’d need to add tasks to a multiprocessing.Pool. This article or this one show examples of pools.
# 2) Care must be taken when using terminate() to stop a process. Here is what the Python documentation has to say
# about it:
# Warning: If this method is used when the associated process is using a pipe or queue then the pipe or queue is
# liable to become corrupted and may become unusable by other process [sic]. Similarly, if the process has acquired a
# lock or semaphore etc. then terminating it is liable to cause other processes to deadlock.
