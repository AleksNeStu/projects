# 16.4 Priority Inversion--Real-Time Concepts for Embedded Systems--嵌入式linux中文站在线图书
---
> _Priority inversion_ is a situation in which a low-priority task executes while a higher priority task waits on it due to resource contentions.

A high task priority implies a more stringent deadline. In a priority-based, preemptive scheduling system, the kernel schedules higher priority tasks first and postpones lower priority tasks until either all of the higher priority tasks are completed or the higher priority tasks voluntarily relinquish the CPU. In real-time embedded systems, the kernel strives to make the schedulability of the highest priority task deterministic. To do this, the kernel must preempt the currently running task and switch the context to run the higher priority task that has just become eligible, all within a known time interval. This system scheduling behavior is the norm when these tasks are independent of each other. Task interdependency is inevitable when tasks share resources and synchronizing activities. Priority inversion occurs when task interdependency exists among tasks with different priorities.

Consider the situation shown in [Figure 16.6](http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/rtconforembsys/5107final/LiB0101.html#figure.Lib182), in which a higher priority task shares a resource with a lower priority task. The higher priority task must wait when the lower priority task has locked the resource, even though the higher priority task is eligible to run.

Figure 16.6: Priority inversion example.

As shown in [Figure 16.6](http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/rtconforembsys/5107final/LiB0101.html#figure.Lib182), at time t1 the low-priority task (LP-task) locks the shared resource. The LP-task continues until time t2 when the high-priority task (HP-task) becomes eligible to run. The scheduler immediately preempts the LP-task and context-switches to the HP-task. The HP-task runs until time t3 when it requires the shared resource. Because the resource is in the locked state, the HP-task must block and wait for its release. At this point, the scheduler context-switches back to the LP-task. Priority inversion begins at time t3. At time t4, the LP-task releases the shared resource, which triggers preemption and allows the HP-task to resume execution. Priority inversion ends at time t4. The HP-task completes at time t5, which allows the LP-task to resume execution and finally complete at time t6.

The priority inversion shown in [Figure 16.6](http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/rtconforembsys/5107final/LiB0101.html#figure.Lib182) is a _bounded priority inversion_. The duration of the low-priority task's holding time on the shared resource is known. It is possible for a medium-priority task to preempt the low-priority task for an undetermined amount of time, which would cause the high-priority task to wait indefinitely. This priority inversion scenario is called _unbounded priority inversion_ and is shown in [Figure 16.7](http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/rtconforembsys/5107final/LiB0101.html#figure.Lib183).

Figure 16.7: Unbounded priority inversion example.

As in the previous example, priority inversion takes place at time t3. The low-priority task (LP-task) executes until time t4 when an unrelated medium-priority task (MP-task) preempts it. Because the MP-task does not share resources with either the HP-task or the LP-task, the MP-task continues execution until it completes at time t5. The duration between t4 and t5 is unknown because the duration depends on the nature of the MP-task. In addition, any number of unrelated medium-priority tasks can execute during this period. These unknown factors affect the interval and translate into unbounded priority inversion.

When priority inversion occurs, the execution times for some tasks are reduced, while others are elongated. In [Figure 16.7](http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/rtconforembsys/5107final/LiB0101.html#figure.Lib183), consider the case in which the high-priority task (HP-task) takes the guarding semaphore before the low-priority task (LP-task). The medium-priority task (MP-task) must wait until the HP-task completes. However, when the MP-task executes first, it is preempted by the HP-task. Again, the MP-task resumes execution after the HP-task completes. In both cases, the overall execution times for the MP-task are longer than the execution time to complete the MP-task during the priority inversion. Although some tasks are completed early, other tasks, such as the HP-task, might miss their deadlines. This issue is called _timing anomaly_ introduced by priority inversion.

Priority inversion results from resource synchronization among tasks of differing priorities. Priority inversion cannot be avoided, but it can be minimized using resource access control protocols.

> A _resource access control protocol_ is a set of rules that defines the conditions under which a resource can be granted to a requesting task and governs the execution scheduling property of the task holding the resource.

Access control protocols are discussed in the following sections. These access control protocols eliminate the unbound priority inversion, and two of these protocols reduce the inversion time.

### 16.4.1 Priority Inheritance Protocol

The Priority Inheritance Protocol is a resource access control protocol that raises the priority of a task, if that task holds a resource being requested by a higher priority task, to the same priority level as the higher priority task. This access control protocol follows the rules in [Table 16.1](http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/rtconforembsys/5107final/LiB0101.html#wbp18Chapter16T10P10) when a task T requests a resource R.

Table 16.1: Priority Inheritance Protocol rules.
| 
Rule #

 | 

Description

 |
| --- | --- |
| 

1

 | 

If R is in use, T is blocked.

 |
| 

2

 | 

If R is free, R is allocated to T.

 |
| 

3

 | 

When a task of a higher priority requests the same resource, T's execution priority is raised to the requesting task's priority level.

 |
| 

4

 | 

The task returns to its previous priority when it releases R.

 |

This access control protocol is shown in [Figure 16.8](http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/rtconforembsys/5107final/LiB0101.html#figure.Lib184).

[![Click To expand](http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/rtconforembsys/5107final/images/1608.jpg)](http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/rtconforembsys/5107final/images/1608_0.jpg)  
Figure 16.8: Priority inheritance protocol example.

With the priority inheritance protocol, when the LP-task blocks the HP-task at time t3, the execution priority is raised to that of the HP-task. This process ensures that unrelated medium-priority tasks cannot interfere while the LP-task executes, which results in the elimination of the unbounded priority inversion. When the LP-task releases control of the shared resource, the priority is immediately lowered to its previous level, which allows the HP-task to preempt its execution. This action ends the priority inversion at time t4. The HP-task continues its execution, however, even when it releases the resource at t5. This is the nature of the priority-based, preemptive scheduling scheme. The HP-task runs because it has the highest priority in the system.

The priority inheritance protocol is dynamic because a task does not have its priority raised until a higher-priority task makes a request on the shared resource. An unrelated higher-priority task can still preempt the task, which is the nature of the priority-based, preemptive scheduling scheme. The priority promotion for a task during priority inversion is transitive, which means the priority of a promoted task continues to rise even if higher-priority tasks make requests on the same shared resource while priority inversion is taking place, as shown in [Figure 16.9](http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/rtconforembsys/5107final/LiB0101.html#figure.Lib185).

[![Click To expand](http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/rtconforembsys/5107final/images/1609.jpg)](http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/rtconforembsys/5107final/images/1609_0.jpg)  
Figure 16.9: Transitive priority promotion example.

In this example, three tasks with differing priorities share a resource. The LP-task acquires the resource first at time t1. At time t2, the MP-task preempts the LP-task and executes until t3 when it needs the resource. The MP-task is blocked. At that point, the LP-task inherits the priority from the MP-task and resumes execution at that level. The HP-task preempts the LP-task when it readies at t4. The HP-task is blocked at t5 when it also needs access to the shared resource. Once more, the LP-task inherits its priority from HP-task and resumes execution at the highest level. As soon as the LP-task completes at time t6, its priority is immediately lowered to the level originally assigned.

In this example, the MP-task can hold some additional resource required by the HP-task. The HP-task can also acquire some other resources needed by the MP-task before the HP-task blocks. When the LP-task releases the resource and the HP-task immediately gets to run, it is deadlocked with the MP-task. Therefore, priority inheritance protocol does not eliminate deadlock.

### 16.4.2 Ceiling Priority Protocol

In the ceiling priority protocol, the priority of every task is known, as are the resources required by every task. For a given resource, the _priority ceiling_ is the highest priority of all possible tasks that might require the resource.

For example, if a resource R is required by four tasks (T1 of priority 4, T2 of priority 9, T3 of priority 10, and T4 of priority 8), the priority ceiling of R is 10, which is the highest priority of the four tasks.

This access control protocol follows the rules in [Table 16.2](http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/rtconforembsys/5107final/LiB0101.html#wbp18Chapter16T11P11) when a task T requests a resource R.

Table 16.2: Ceiling priority protocol rules.
| 
Rule #

 | 

Description

 |
| --- | --- |
| 

1

 | 

If R is in use, T is blocked.

 |
| 

2

 | 

If R is free, R is allocated to T. T's execution priority is raised to the priority ceiling of R if that is higher. At any given time, T's execution priority equals the highest priority ceiling of all its held resources.

 |
| 

3

 | 

T's priority is assigned the next-highest priority ceiling of another resource when the resource with the highest priority ceiling is released.

 |
| 

4

 | 

The task returns to its assigned priority after it has released all resources.

 |

This access control protocol is shown in [Figure 16.10](http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/rtconforembsys/5107final/LiB0101.html#figure.Lib186).

[![Click To expand](http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/rtconforembsys/5107final/images/1610.jpg)](http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/rtconforembsys/5107final/images/1610_0.jpg)  
Figure 16.10: Ceiling priority protocol example.

With the ceiling priority protocol, the task inherits the priority ceiling of the resource as soon as the task acquires the resource even when no other higher priority tasks contend for the same resource. This rule implies that all critical sections from every sharing task have the same criticality level. The idea is to finish the critical section as soon as possible to avoid possible conflicts.

### 16.4.3 Priority Ceiling Protocol

Similarly to the ceiling priority protocol, the priority of every task is known in the priority ceiling protocol. The resources that every task requires are also known before execution. The _current priority ceiling_ for a running system at any time is the highest priority ceiling of all resources in use at that time.

For example, if four resources are in use and if R1 has a priority ceiling of 4, R2 has a priority ceiling of 9, R3 of a priority ceiling 10, and R4 of a priority ceiling 8, the current priority ceiling of the system is 10. Note that different tasks can hold these resources.

This access control protocol follows the rules in [Table 16.3](http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/rtconforembsys/5107final/LiB0101.html#wbp18Chapter16T12P12) when a task T requests a resource R.

Table 16.3: Priority ceiling protocol rules.
| 
Rule #

 | 

Description

 |
| --- | --- |
| 

1

 | 

If R is in use, T is blocked.

 |
| 

2

 | 

If R is free and if the priority of T is higher than the current priority ceiling, R is allocated to T.

 |
| 

3

 | 

If the current priority ceiling belongs to one of the resources that T currently holds, R is allocated to T, and otherwise T is blocked

 |
| 

4

 | 

The task that blocks T inherits T's priority if it is higher and executes at this priority until it releases every resource whose priority ceiling is higher than or equal to T's priority. The task then returns to its previous priority.

 |

In the priority ceiling protocol, a requesting task can be blocked for one of three causes. The first cause is when the resource is current in use, which is _direct resource contention blocking,_ and is the result of rule #1. The second cause is when the blocking task has inherited a higher priority and its current execution priority is higher than that of the requesting task. This cause is _priority inheritance blocking_ and is the result of rule #4. A task can be blocked when its priority is lower than the current priority ceiling even when the requested resource is free. This cause is _priority ceiling blocking_ and is a direct consequence of the 'otherwise' clause of rule #3. Rule #3 prevents a task from blocking itself if it holds a resource that has defined the current priority ceiling.

One of the deadlock prevention strategies in the 'Deadlock Prevention' on [page 272](http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/rtconforembsys/5107final/LiB0100.html#724), [section 16.3](http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/rtconforembsys/5107final/LiB0100.html#702).5, is to impose ordering on the resources. The resource ordering can be realized by using the priority ceilings of the resources. Rule #2 says if the priority of T is higher than the current priority ceiling, T does not require any resources that are in use. This issue occurs because otherwise the current priority ceiling would be either equal to or higher than the priority of T, which implies that tasks with a priority higher than T's do not require the resources currently in use. Consequently, none of the tasks that are holding resources in use can inherit a higher priority, preempt task T, and then request a resource that T holds. This feature prevents the circular-wait condition. This feature is also why deadlock cannot occur when using the priority ceiling protocol as an access control protocol. The same induction process shows that the condition in which a task blocks another task but is in turn blocked by a third task, transitive blocking, does not occur under the priority ceiling protocol.

The priority ceiling protocol has these characteristics:

-   A requesting task can be blocked by only one task; therefore, the blocking interval is at most the duration of one critical section.
    
-   Transitive blocking never occurs under the priority ceiling protocol.
    
-   Deadlock never occurs under the priority ceiling protocol.
