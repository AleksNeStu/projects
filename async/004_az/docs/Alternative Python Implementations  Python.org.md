This site hosts the "traditional" implementation of Python (nicknamed CPython). A number of alternative implementations
are available as well, namely

- [IronPython](http://ironpython.net/) (Python running on .NET)
- [Jython](http://www.jython.org/) (Python running on the Java Virtual Machine)
- [PyPy](http://pypy.org/) (A [fast](http://speed.pypy.org/) python implementation with a JIT compiler)
- [Stackless Python](http://www.stackless.com/) (Branch of CPython supporting microthreads)
- [MicroPython](http://micropython.org/) (Python running on micro controllers)

Other parties have re-packaged CPython. These re-packagings often include more libraries or are specialized for a
particular application:

- [ActiveState ActivePython](http://www.activestate.com/activepython/) (commercial and community versions, including
  scientific computing modules)
- [pythonxy](http://python-xy.github.io/) (Scientific-oriented Python Distribution based on Qt and Spyder)
- [winpython](http://winpython.github.io/) (WinPython is a portable scientific Python distribution for Windows)
- [Conceptive Python SDK](http://www.conceptive.be/python-sdk.html) (targets business, desktop and database
  applications)
- [Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/) (a commercial distribution for scientific computing)
- [PyIMSL Studio](http://www.roguewave.com/products/imsl-numerical-libraries/pyimsl-studio.aspx) (a commercial
  distribution for numerical analysis â€“ free for non-commercial use)
- [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (a full Python distribution for data management, analysis
  and visualization of large data sets)
- [eGenix PyRun](https://www.egenix.com/products/python/PyRun/) (a portable Python runtime, complete with stdlib, frozen
  into a single 3.5MB - 13MB executable file)

If you want to host and run Python in the cloud, these implementations may be right for you:

- [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) (freemium hosted Python installation which lets you run Python in
  the browser, e.g. for tutorials, showcases, etc.)
