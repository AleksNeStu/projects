# Using a daemon thread is not a good idea
# The Python threading documentation explains that a thread may be started as a daemon, meaning that “the entire Python
# program exits when only daemon threads are left”. The main program itself is not a daemon thread.
# Note: Daemon threads are abruptly stopped at shutdown. Their resources (such as open files, database transactions,
# etc.)
# may not be released properly. If you want your threads to stop gracefully, make them non-daemonic and use a suitable
# signalling mechanism such as an Event.


# A clean thread exit using events and signals
# https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.Event
# Event is a simple object that can be set or cleared. It can be used to signal to the thread that it needs perform
# its cleanup and then stop.

# The idea is to use such an event here (let us call it a stop event). Initially not set, the stop event becomes set
# when a keyboard interrupt is received. The worker thread then breaks out from the loop if the stop event is set and
# performs its cleanup.

import threading as th
import time
import os

stop_event = th.Event()

        # windows. Need CTRL_C_EVENT to raise the signal in the whole process group
        os.kill(pid, signal.CTRL_C_EVENT)
    else:
        # unix

    # Notice that when the thread is stopped it now finally gets to the print('Thread done') line (a placeholder for
    # an actual cleanup task)
    # Moreover, the main program also gets to the print('Program done') line.
    print('Thread done')


# The idea is to use such an event here (let us call it a stop event). Initially not set,
#  must have two arguments, the signal and the frame, even though the second argument is not used:

# Clean exit from a thread can therefore be achieved using a threading event and a signal handler.

    # the stop event becomes set when a keyboard interrupt is received.
    # The stop event needs to be set when a keyboard interrupt is intercepted. This is done by registering the SIGINT
    # signal with a handler function.
