# Getting help — AnyIO 4.0.0 documentation
---
If you are having trouble with AnyIO, make sure you’ve first checked
the [FAQ](https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq.html) to see if your question is answered there. If not, you have a
couple ways for getting support:

- Post a question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and use the `anyio` tag

- Join the [python-trio/AnyIO](https://gitter.im/python-trio/AnyIO) room on Gitter

## Reporting bugs[¶](https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/support.html#reporting-bugs "Link to this heading")

If you’re fairly certain that you have discovered a bug, you
can [file an issue](https://github.com/agronholm/anyio/issues) on Github. If you feel unsure, come talk to us first! The
issue tracker is **not** the proper venue for asking support questions.
