"""
Capacity limiters are like semaphores except that a single borrower (the current task by default) can only hold a
single token at a time. It is also possible to borrow a token on behalf of any arbitrary object, so long as that
object is hashable.

You can adjust the total number of tokens by setting a different value on the limiterâ€™s total_tokens property
