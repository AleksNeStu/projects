"""
Approach taken by Trio, an alternative async Python framework.

import asyncio
from asyncio import Queue

import trio

"""
In trio nurseries are context managers that expose an interface similar to asyncio.create_task.

Trio ensures that the async with block will not exit until both tasks have completed. Arbitrary computation, including await statements, can be done before, in-between, and after task creation. To aid with this, nurseries also offer a blocking start call, which allows waiting for a task to initialize but not finish. For example, we may want to wait for a consumer task to establish connection to a message broker before proceeding with a corresponding producer task. Arbitrary nesting is allowed—tasks can open their own nurseries internally, which creates a hierarchical structure with clearly defined parent-child relationships. To retrieve return values from tasks, it is common to use a shared object, such as an async-ready queue or a plain dictionary.

 In many cases, however, tasks primarily need to pass information between one another, which is commonly achieved by passing a shared queue reference, as seen in the example.

async def child1():
    print("child1 start")
    await trio.sleep(1)
    print("child1 done")

async def child2():
    print("child2 start")
    await trio.sleep(2)
    print("child2 done")


async def parent():
    # Trio ensures that the async with block will not exit until both tasks have completed.
    async with trio.open_nursery() as nursery:
        print("parent start")
        nursery.start_soon(child1)
        nursery.start_soon(child2)
        print("parent wait for childs")

    print("parent done")


trio.run(parent)


"""
Now, let us return to the world of Python, where the majority of async libraries—and therefore applications using them—only aim for asyncio compatibility. One may rightfully question the practicality of Trio’s nurseries in such an ecosystem, apart from a theoretical proof of concept. Fortunately, the amazing AnyIO project implements structured concurrency on top of asyncio, making it available for widespread use.
