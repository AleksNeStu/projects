- [ABC — Abstract Base Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html) \
  This module provides the infrastructure for defining abstract base classes (ABCs) in Python, as outlined in PEP 3119; see the PEP for why this was added to Python. (See also PEP 3141 and the numbers module regarding a type hierarchy for numbers based on ABCs.)
- [AST - Abstract Syntax Trees](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html) \
  The ast module helps Python applications to process trees of the Python abstract syntax grammar. The abstract syntax itself might change with each Python release; this module helps to find out programmatically what the current grammar looks like.

  - [attrs](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/#getting-started)
  In addition to tuple, dict, namedtuple, and attrs, there are many other similar projects, including typing.NamedTuple, namedlist, attrdict, plumber, and fields.
- [dis](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html) \
  dis — Disassembler for Python bytecode\
  The dis module supports the analysis of CPython bytecode by disassembling it. The CPython bytecode which this module takes as an input is defined in the file Include/opcode.h and used by the compiler and the interpreter.
- [__del__](https://pencilprogrammer.com/__del__-in-python/#:~:text=__del__%20is%20a,also%20known%20as%20the%20finalizer.) \
  __del__ is a reserved function in Python that is called when the last reference to an object is being deleted or goes out of scope.
It is similar to the destructor of C++ and is also known as the finalizer. \

  Method Resolution Order(MRO) it denotes the way a programming language resolves a method or attribute. Python supports classes inheriting from other classes. The class being inherited is called the Parent or Superclass, while the class that inherits is called the Child or Subclass.

- [PVM (Python Virtual Machine](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/blogs/pvmpython-virtual-machine) \
  When we run a Python program, two steps happen,
  The code gets converted to another representation called ‘Byte Code’
  ‘Byte Code’ gets converted to Machine Code (which is understandable by the computer).

  str() is used for creating output for end user while repr() is mainly used for debugging and development. repr’s goal is to be unambiguous and str’s is to be readable

> Versions
- [Jython](https://www.jython.org/) \
  Jython is a Java implementation of Python that combines expressive power with clarity. Jython is freely available for both commercial and non-commercial use and is distributed with source code under the PSF License v2. Jython is complementary to Java and is especially suited for the following tasks.


- [ironpython](https://ironpython.net/) \
  IronPython is an open-source implementation of the Python programming language which is tightly integrated with .NET. IronPython can use .NET and Python libraries, and other .NET languages can use Python code just as easily.


- [CPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython) \
  CPython is the reference implementation of the Python programming language. Written in C and Python, CPython is the default and most widely used implementation of the Python language.


- [Cython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cython) \
  Cython is a programming language that aims to be a superset of the Python programming language, designed to give C-like performance with code that is written mostly in Python with optional additional C-inspired syntax. 
  Cython is a NumFOCUS affiliated project. \


- [PyPy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyPy) \
  PyPy (/ˈpaɪpaɪ/) is an alternative implementation of the Python programming language to CPython (which is the standard implementation). PyPy often runs faster than CPython because PyPy uses a just-in-time compiler. Most Python code runs well on PyPy except for code that depends on CPython extensions, which either does not work or incurs some overhead when run in PyPy.
